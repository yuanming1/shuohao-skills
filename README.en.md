**Agent skills for AI short-drama production** — from a novel to shoot-ready material: character bibles, adaptation outlines, scene & prop bibles, screenplays, storyboards. Built for AI coding agents, **runs in both Claude Code and codex**.

Here is the whole pipeline — **the outline converges the structure; script, scenes and characters iterate together; the storyboard only outputs, it makes no new decisions**:

<img src="assets/pipeline-en.webp" alt="AI short-drama production pipeline" width="680">

| Skill | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| [**novel-outline**](skills/novel-outline/README.en.md) | Adapts a novel into a five-piece short-drama outline: adaptation notes, cast, beats, per-episode synopses, asset list (including a narrative-prop table). All 14 quality gates are script-checked; includes a checkup mode for existing outlines |
| [**novel-characters**](skills/novel-characters/README.en.md) | Turns the cast the outline settled on into a character bible: profiles, design prompts, voice prompts, model sheets. Seeds the roster from outline.json; report language is configurable |
| [**character-refs**](skills/character-refs/README.en.md) | **Actually generates** reference images for characters from any story (not just novels — your own original story works too): describe a character in one message; it is split into fields, gaps filled and confirmed, then a front full-body anchor is generated and every other view (headshot, 90° profile, back, details) references only that anchor, in on-demand tiers. Every image is labeled and individually regenerable, with staleness tracked. Works with Qwen Image (ComfyUI), codex image generation, the GPT Image 2 API, or a custom command |
| [**novel-art**](skills/novel-art/README.en.md) | Art bibles for AI production (scenes + narrative props): consistency anchors, lighting & state variants, scale references, no-people/no-hands white plates. Seeds from outline.json; all 10 quality gates script-checked |
| [**novel-script**](skills/novel-script/README.en.md) | Screenwriting for AI short drama: scenes + beat flow (action beats alternating with dialogue lines), per-episode duration deterministically estimated from reading speed, a gated cold-open hook in the first 3 beats, a per-character line book with voice prompts that feeds straight into TTS. All 10 quality gates script-checked |
| [**novel-storyboard**](skills/novel-storyboard/README.en.md) | Storyboarding for AI short drama: segments (one generation, ≤15s) → cuts (2–5s hard gate) → keyframes (master pinned at 0.00s, sub-frames at their cut marks), with MiniMax H3 prompt alignment and cut times audited verbatim; frames actually generated with the design sheets as references, plus one-command H3 / Seedance production packs. All 18 quality gates script-checked |

**The five pipeline skills render their reports in English too** — reports default to a Chinese UI; pass `--lang en` to `render` for a fully English report (data content stays as authored). character-refs ships Chinese, English and Japanese UIs too, and translates on the spot for other languages.

## One page for the whole pipeline

The five stage reports can be merged into a single page with a left-hand nav — **you get a pane for every stage you actually have**:

```bash
node scripts/report.mjs --from <demo-dir> --out report.html
```

`--from` discovers the five json files using the [working-directory convention](#repository-conventions); you can also point at each one directly (`--outline` `--cast` `--art` `--script` `--storyboard`). Ran only the character pass? You get one pane, no error.

It is an **assembler, not a separate skill**: it imports no skill code, it shells out to each skill's own `render --html` and stitches the results. So the five skills stay untouched, still run standalone, and are still copyable on their own — and when a skill changes its rendering, this picks it up for free.

Merging solves three problems, **all of them inside the assembler, none inside the skills**:

- **Style bleed.** The five reports share 57 class names, 13 of which mean different things in different reports (`.copy`, `.kpis`, `.badge`, `.chip`…), so every selector gets a scope prefix
- **Script bleed.** Each report's script does document-wide lookups like `document.querySelector('.expo')`. Merged, that only ever finds the first one — all five export buttons would break. Each script gets wrapped in a scoping proxy
- **Asset paths.** Each report's images are relative to its own json directory (`images/…`, `E01-01/f1.png`) and get rebased against the output file

One pane shows at a time by default (the five together run to roughly 600k characters). "Show all" in the bottom-left expands every pane so Cmd+F reaches the whole document. Number keys `1`–`5` switch panes, and `#pane-script` deep-links straight to one.

```bash
node scripts/report-selftest.mjs   # 92 assertions, no browser needed
```

Point it at a novel and you get all five:

**novel-outline · short-drama adaptation outline**

![Adaptation outline report](skills/novel-outline/assets/report.webp)

**novel-characters · character bible**

![Character bible report](skills/novel-characters/assets/report.webp)

**novel-art · art bible (scenes + props, sheets actually generated by the skill)**

![Art bible report](skills/novel-art/assets/report.webp)

**novel-script · screenplay (duration gauge + episode scripts + line book)**

![Screenplay report](skills/novel-script/assets/report.webp)

**novel-storyboard · storyboard (cut rhythm strip + master/sub keyframes actually generated by the skill + H3 prompts)**

![Storyboard report](skills/novel-storyboard/assets/report.webp)

No novel needed for this one — real reference images for any character:

**character-refs · character references (anchor by GPT, the rest by Qwen, all actually generated by the skill)**

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eternityspring/shuohao-skills.git
cd shuohao-skills
./scripts/install.sh
```

It detects whether you have Claude Code or codex installed and **symlinks** every skill into place — so `git pull` takes effect immediately, with no reinstall.

```bash
./scripts/install.sh novel-characters   # just one skill
./scripts/install.sh --codex            # only into codex
./scripts/install.sh --uninstall        # remove the symlinks
```

Prefer to do it by hand:

```bash
ln -s "$PWD/skills/novel-characters" ~/.claude/skills/novel-characters
ln -s "$PWD/skills/novel-characters" ~/.codex/skills/novel-characters
```

## Requirements

| | Required? | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Node** | Yes | ≥ 18. The skill scripts use only the standard library — **no npm dependencies, nothing to install** |
| **Model quota** | Yes | Uses your current session's quota. **No API key needed** |
| **codex CLI** | Optional | Just one of the two runtimes these skills run in, equivalent to Claude Code. The five pipeline skills **do not generate images**, so none of its local capabilities are needed |
| **Image model** | Only for character-refs | One of: your own ComfyUI (Qwen Image), local codex image generation (uses your ChatGPT plan quota), an OpenAI API key (GPT Image 2), or a custom command. Chosen on first use |

> **Note on output language.** These skills are Chinese-first. `novel-characters` produces Chinese character profiles even for an English source novel, and its validator actively rejects English in those fields. See that skill's README for what it would take to change.

## Repository conventions

One directory per skill, **self-contained and copyable on its own**:

```
skills/<skill-name>/
├── SKILL.md          the workflow the agent reads (required)
├── README.md         the docs a human reads
├── scripts/
│   ├── <name>.mjs    deterministic helpers, zero dependencies
│   └── selftest.mjs  self-test, never calls a model (required)
├── references/       detailed instructions, loaded on demand
├── examples/         bundled samples that double as test fixtures
└── assets/           screenshots
```

Two hard requirements:

- Every skill must have a `SKILL.md`
- Every skill must have a `scripts/selftest.mjs` that **calls no model and costs no quota**, covering all deterministic logic

Run every self-test before adding a skill:

```bash
for f in skills/*/scripts/selftest.mjs; do node "$f"; done
```

There is no CI — the self-tests run in about a second, so running them locally beats waiting on a pipeline. **Only tested on macOS with Node 24**; there is no platform-specific code, so Linux and older Node releases should be fine, but that is unverified.
